# Container Runtime Debugging Support (aka Duct Tape)

_Caution: this is work-in-progress_

This repository gathers additional dependencies required to debug
particular language runtimes with [`skaffold debug`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/how-tos/debug/). 
These dependencies are packaged as a set of container images suitable
for use as `initContainer`s on a pod.  When executed, a container image
copies these dependencies to `/dbg/<runtimeId>`.

The idea is that `skaffold debug` will transform k8s manifests to
make available any support files required to debug specific language
runtimes.  For example, a Kubernetes podspec would be transformed to

  - mount a volume on `/dbg` to hold the debugging support files
  - run one or more of these `initContainer`s to populate the volume
  - mount the volume on the applicable containers as `/dbg`

Current language runtimes:
  * `go`: provides [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve)
  * `python`: provides [`ptvsd`](https://github.com/Microsoft/ptvsd),
    a debug adapter that can be used for VS Code and more, for
    Python 2.7 and 3.7
  * `netcore`: provides `vsdbg` for .NET Core

## Development

This directory includes a `skaffold.yaml` for development of the
these `duct-tape` initContainer images.  Each image is expected to
be standalone and not require downloading content across the network.
To add support for a new language runtime, an image definition
should download the necessary files into the container image.  The
image's entrypoint should then copy those files into place at
`/dbg/<runtime>`.  The image should be added to the `skaffold.yaml`
and referenced within `test/k8s-test-installation.yaml`.
